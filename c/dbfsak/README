I wrote this program (dbfdump) because of the fact that Midnight
Commander uses a program called dbview, which doesn't work. Looking over
the docs/source for dbview, it appears it was written long ago,
abandoned, and then someone resurrected it with little or no
modification. When I've tried to run it, it often hasn't worked. I
needed something to display FoxPro data files, so I wrote this little
program. Now, I just do a symlink from dbview to dbfdump (I made the
command lines similar), and off I go.

I'll leave it to the man page to tell you how to run it.

Compilation and installation are the usual:

make ; make install

Installation is in the /usr/local tree. If you don't like this, edit the
makefile.

There are no extraordinary dependencies with this program. It is written
in C++ and relies only on g++ and the standard C/C++ libraries.

This was a quicky program. The code is not beautiful, and I do not take
advantage of some of the features of C++. For instance, iostreams. As
far as I'm concerned, they are a pain, so I don't use them. If you have
suggestions for improvement or bug reports, feel free. If you'd like to
contribute code, let me know.

I cannot claim perfection in this program. It may well have bugs. As
such, I make no claims about the suitability of these programs for your
application, and cannot assume responsibility for your use of them, or
the results thereof.

Naturally, this program is released under an Open Source license. Do
with it as you will, but give me credit for the original work, if you
please.
